# Game Mode Architecture

## Class Hierarchy

`GameMode` (abstract base) → `PlayerMode` (human vs human) | `BotMode` (human vs engine, composes `EngineProvider*`).

## GameMode (base)

Central fields injected via constructor: `boardDriver_`, `wifiManager_`, `chess_` (`Game` orchestrator), `logger_` (`Log` proxy, wraps optional `ILogger*`). All log output uses `logger_.info/infof/error/errorf(...)` directly — the `Log` proxy handles null internally. No direct `Serial` calls.

### Lifecycle
- `begin()` — pure virtual. Subclasses set up the game (resume or new), then call `waitForBoardSetup()`.
- `update()` — pure virtual. Called repeatedly from the main loop. Must be **non-blocking**.
- `isGameOver()` — delegates to `chess_->isGameOver()`.
- `isNavigationAllowed()` — virtual, default `true`. BotMode blocks navigation during engine thinking.

### Core Move Flow
1. `tryPlayerMove(playerColor, ...)` — scans sensor deltas for a piece lift, shows legal-move highlights (white = empty, red = capture, purple = en-passant pawn), waits for placement. Returns `true` with from/to coords when a valid destination is chosen.
2. `applyMove(from, to, promotion, isRemoteMove)` — calls `chess_->makeMove()` (which handles all move/game-end/check logging), then drives hardware feedback (capture animation, castling rook guidance, promotion animation, check blink, game-end fireworks).
3. `applyMove(string)` — coordinate-string overload, parses then delegates with `isRemoteMove = true`.

### Resume Support
`tryResumeGame()` — checks `chess_->hasActiveGame()`, calls `resumeGame()`. Returns `true` if a live game was resumed from flash.

### Board Setup
`waitForBoardSetup(targetBoard)` — blocking loop that lights LEDs to guide the player to the required position (white/black = place here, red = remove this). Ends with firework animation.

### Resign System
Three-phase king-based resign gesture managed in `GameMode`: hold king off square (3s) → 2 quick lift-and-returns with escalating orange brightness → board confirm dialog → `chess_->endGame(RESIGN, ...)`.

Virtual hooks let subclasses customize: `isFlipped()`, `onBeforeResignConfirm()`, `onResignCancelled()`, `onResignConfirmed(color)`. BotMode uses these to cancel/restart the engine and notify the provider.

Web resign: `setResignPending(true)` → `processResign()` checks the flag at the start of `update()`.

### Remote Move Guidance
`waitForRemoteMoveCompletion(...)` — virtual, no-op in base. BotMode overrides to block with LED guidance until the player physically executes the engine's move on the board.

## PlayerMode

Minimal subclass — `begin()` resumes or starts a `GameModeId::CHESS_MOVES` game. `update()` calls `tryPlayerMove(currentTurn)` for alternating colors.

## BotMode

Composes an `EngineProvider*` (strategy pattern, owned — deleted in destructor).

### State Machine (`BotState`)
- `PLAYER_TURN` — `tryPlayerMove()` polls sensors. On valid move: `applyMove()`, notify provider via `onPlayerMoveApplied()`, then if game continues and it's engine's turn → transition to `ENGINE_THINKING`.
- `ENGINE_THINKING` — `provider_->checkResult()` polls the background task. On result: `stopThinking()`, apply engine move or handle remote game-end, transition back to `PLAYER_TURN`.

### begin() Flow
1. Check WiFi → abort if disconnected.
2. Show waiting animation → `provider_->initialize()` (may block for HTTP).
3. Stop animation → check init result.
4. Resume or start new game with `initResult.gameModeId`, `playerColor_`, `depth`.
5. `waitForBoardSetup()`.
6. If engine's turn first → immediately `requestMove()` + enter `ENGINE_THINKING`.

### Navigation
`isNavigationAllowed()` returns `false` during `ENGINE_THINKING` (prevents menu access while engine is working).

### Error Handling
`abortWithError(message)` — red flash + `endGame(ABORTED, ' ')`. Used for WiFi failure, init failure, and provider errors.

## Design Decisions

- **Resign lives in GameMode, not BotMode** — both PlayerMode and BotMode need resign. Putting it in the base class avoids duplication. The virtual hooks (`onBeforeResignConfirm`, `onResignCancelled`, `onResignConfirmed`) let BotMode add engine-specific behavior (cancel request, restart thinking) without duplicating the 3-phase gesture flow.

- **`tryPlayerMove()` is blocking within a non-blocking loop** — once a piece is lifted, `tryPlayerMove()` enters a blocking wait for placement. This is intentional: the sensor state during piece-in-hand requires continuous polling for the target square. The outer `update()` loop remains non-blocking because `tryPlayerMove()` returns `false` (no lift detected) on most ticks.

- **`applyMove()` handles all hardware feedback in one place** — capture animation, castling rook guidance, promotion animation, check blink, game-end fireworks are all in `GameMode::applyMove()`. Game-end and check/turn *logging* is handled by `Game` (not duplicated here). Subclasses don't override this. This centralizes the complex hardware interaction sequence so adding a new game mode only requires implementing `begin()` and `update()`.

- **Remote moves use LED guidance** — when BotMode applies an engine move, `waitForRemoteMoveCompletion()` blocks with LED cues (cyan = pick up, green = place here) until the player physically executes the move. This bridges the gap between software state (already applied) and physical board state (player must move the piece).

- **BotMode owns the provider** — `BotMode` deletes the `EngineProvider*` in its destructor. This makes game mode transitions clean: destroying a `BotMode` automatically cancels any running engine task and frees the provider. The provider is never shared between modes.

- **Navigation blocked during engine thinking** — `isNavigationAllowed()` returns `false` in `ENGINE_THINKING`. Without this, a menu navigation during an active FreeRTOS task would corrupt state. The web UI gets `409 Conflict` from `POST /nav` during this window.
